        Student Game Developers is a CIO at The University of Virginia. 
        The group was established in 2006 by Brice Morrison and Scott Geiser. 
        Having gone under several changes since its founding, the group continues 
        to support the creation of several original video games each semester and 
        provides industry resources and contacts for aspiring game developers at 
        The University.

        Student Game Developers seeks to bring together student programmers and 
        artists to provide opportunities to gain experience in game development 
        through team projects. In addition, SGD seeks to explore and increase 
        knowledge of the game development industry, while simultaneously help 
        establish networking connections for its members. The intention of the group 
        is not to simply play games, but to be actively involved in the art and 
        science of creating them, whether as a hobby or as preparation for a career.
