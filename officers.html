                        Ian Harvey is a 3rd year in the School of Engineering majoring in Computer Science and minoring
                        in both English and business. He is responsible for the masterpiece of a game known only as
                        Atlas during the Fall 2021 semester and is looking forward to working on more club projects in
                        the future. His interests find themselves deeply invested in the extraordinary potentials of
                        game design. Unlimited by the boundaries of conventional media, games to him represent the
                        culmination of all that could ever be made by the human heart. In a sense, they are a means to
                        explore all avenues of art at once, and, by that concept, he views the craft of game development
                        as something capable of discovering every individual artistic strength and weakness that may
                        manifest in the individual. Philosophy aside, Ian enjoys creative writing and playing games in
                        his free time. His favorite game at the moment (the fool that he is) is Destiny 2. On the side,
                        he is writing a book that he hopes to one day finish.
